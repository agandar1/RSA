# RSA
RSA implementations in C++ and Common Lisp

The C++ program was a homework for a cryptography class.<br>
I wrote the Lisp program to help prototype the program design.<br>
The interactive development made it a great choice for this. <br>

Both programs include implementations of the euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers and the modulo inverse of a number, as well as implementations for fast exponentation by squaring and fast generation of lange random prime numbers.
